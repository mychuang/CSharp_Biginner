# Dates and Times

## The DateTime Type

C# has built-in support for dates and times in the form of the System.DateTime type. This type can be used to represent a date and time, and it provides static access to the system clock which can be used to get the current time and/or date. <p>
下方展示一些範例: 

```C#
var currentTime = DateTime.Now;

var today = DateTime.Today;

var someDate = new DateTime(2016,7,1);

var someMoment = new DateTime(2016,7,1,8,0,0);

var tomorrow = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);

var yesterday = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1);

var someDay = DateTime.Parse("7/1/2016");
```

## Getting to Parts of Dates and Times
DateTime type has many properties you can use to access different individual components of the date or time, such as the month, day, year, hour, minute, etc. The following sample demonstrates some of these properties:

```C#
var someTime = new DateTime(2016,7,1,11,10,9); // 1 July 2016 11:10:09 AM

int year = someTime.Year; // 2016

int month = someTime.Month; // 7

int day = someTime.Day; // 1

int hour = someTime.Hour; // 11

int minute = someTime.Minute; // 10

int second = someTime.Second; // 9
```

## Calculating Durations Between DateTimes
Sometimes it can be useful to think about the difference between two times, or the duration of an event. For instance, you could calculate how many days are left in the year. To do so, you would need to determine the first day of the next year, and then compare that to today. The following code shows how to do this:

```C#
DateTime nextYear = new DateTime(DateTime.Today.Year+1, 1, 1);

TimeSpan duration = nextYear - DateTime.Today;

Console.WriteLine($"There are {duration.TotalDays} days left in the year");
```
