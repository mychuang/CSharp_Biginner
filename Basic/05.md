# if-else & Switch

Because the **if** statement depends on a condition, the statement is sometimes referred to as a conditional statement.<br> 
One common use for these statements is validating user input, such as checking to see if any arguments have been passed to a program or method.<br> 
When you write an **if** statement, it consists of the **if** keyword, a logical expression inside of parentheses, and then one or more statements. <br>
一個簡單的範例如下:
```c#
static void Greet(string name){
    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(name)) return;

    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
}
```

或是在**if** statement 使用 curly braces (**{** **}**)

```c#
var sum = 10;
if (someCondition){
    sum = sum + 5;
    sum = sum * 2;
}
```

多判斷時，可以加入 **else** or **else if**

```c#
int x, y, answer;
Console.Write("Enter x =");
x = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.Write("Enter y =");
y = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

if (x > y){
    answer = x;
}else if(x == y){
    answer = x;
}else{
    x = y;
}

Console.Write("The big number = {0}", answer);
```

The **switch** keyword is used to have your program execute a different section of code for potentially many different cases.<br> 
The **switch** statement relies on the value of a single statement. You can use a **switch** statement to achieve the same behavior as you can with an **if-else** statement in many cases, but generally switch is preferred when you have more than a few options to deal with.

```c#
uint guessedNumber = 1; // try different numbers to see resulting behavior
switch (guessedNumber){
    case 0:
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, 0 is not a valid guess.");
        break;
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("You guessed low.");
        break;
    case 4:
        Console.WriteLine("You guessed the right number!");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("You guessed high.");
        break;
}
```
In the example above, you can see how multiple different case labels (in this case, 1, 2, and 3) can be applied to a single switch section ("You guessed low").
